Here is the task:
- Create an automated procedure for deploying and updating [a Backstage instance](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) while gracefully handling failures.
- It would be nice to provide a way to test your procedure locally (for example, with containers) and a document with instructions on how to use your method.

Requirements
- No particular technology is required you can choose to use whatever you like
- Your procedure should be resilient to errors and leave the installation in a working state even if something wrong happens during an update.
